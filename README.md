<h2>This project aims to make you code in C a library of usual functions that will be used for next projects.</h2>

Since in most 42 projects we can't use any of the standard C library functions, the goal of this first project is to replicate some of the usual functions ourselves, as well as some additional functions.

We have to build a library that we will be able to use in our future projects.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives :
Reviewing.
Basics of programming.

ðŸ’¾ Skills :
Imperative programming
Unix
Rigor

ðŸ“š Subject :

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.
Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. However, when working on a new project, donâ€™t forget to ensure the functions used in your library are allowed in the project guidelines.
